        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <div class="content has-text-justified">
A central challenge towards developing robots that can relate human language to their perception and actions is the scarcity of natural language annotations in diverse robot datasets. Moreover, robot policies that follow natural language instructions are typically trained on either templated language or expensive human-labeled instructions, hindering their scalability. To this end, we introduce <b>NILS</b>: <b>N</b>atural language <b>I</b>nstruction <b>L</b>abeling for <b>S</b>calability. NILS automatically labels uncurated, long-horizon robot data at scale in a zero-shot manner without any human intervention. NILS combines pre-trained vision-language foundation models in a sophisticated, carefully considered manner in order to detect objects in a scene, detect object-centric changes, segment tasks from large datasets of unlabelled interaction data and ultimately label behavior datasets. Evaluations on BridgeV2 and a kitchen play dataset show that NILS is able to autonomously annotate diverse robot demonstrations of unlabeled and unstructured datasets, while alleviating several shortcomings of crowdsourced human annotations.

## Architecture
![MDT-V Overview](./static/image/lupus-example.png)
Overview of the proposed NILS framework for labeling long-horizon robot play sequences
in a zero-shot manner using an ensemble of pretrained expert models. NILS consists of three stages:
 - all relevant objects in the video are detected
 - object-centric changes are detected and collected
 - object change information is used to detect keystates and an LLM is prompted to generate a language label for the task
